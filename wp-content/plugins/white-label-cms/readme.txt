Allows customization of dashboard and logos, removal of menus, giving editors access to widgets and menus plus lots more.

== Description ==
The White Label CMS plugin is for developers who want to give their clients a more personalised and less confusing CMS.

Important - For user wanting to use their existing logos, please select the Classic Header/Footer Height in the Branding section.

For a video overview of the changes in 1.3 and how this affects WordPress 3.2 please visit the [White Label CMS](http://www.videousermanuals.com/white-label-cms/ "White Label CMS") home hosted on the [WordPress Manual Plugin](http://www.videousermanuals.com/ "WordPress Manual Plugin") website.

You have the ability to choose which menus appear.  We have 3 CMS profiles of Website, Blog or Custom so you can modify the menu system to suit the CMS purpose. These only apply to user role of Editor and below.

For WordPress 3 users, you can give Editors access to the Menu and Widgets, but the switch theme option will not appear.

White Label CMS allows you to remove all the panels from the WordPress dashboard and insert your own panel, which you can use to write a personalised message to your client and link to the important elements in the CMS.

It also allows you to add custom logos to the header and footer as well as the all important login page, giving your client a better branded experience of using their new website.

There is also the option to hide the nag updates as well.

No longer will you have to tell your clients to ignore the dashboard!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Who is this plugin for?=
For developers who handover websites to their clients and use WordPress as a CMS.

=How to I add links to my own panel?=
Your custom panel accepts html, so just write the markup as you normally would in html.

=How do I remove menu items?=
Click on the Remove Menus section and either choose a CMS profile, or manually select which menu items to be removed. Please not this will only effect user roles of Editor and below. So you will need to logout in order to see the difference.

=How do you recommend using this plugin?=
We have been using this for a number of months now, and we have found clients respond best when it is set up in the following fashion:

* Use the clients logo for the login (it gives the CMS a bit of a wow factor!)
* Use the clients logo in the header
* Use your own logo in the footer, and place a link back to your website
* Remove all panels from the dashboard (they have a lot of information that just confuses the client)
* Add your own panel. Personalise the experience for your client by welcoming them to their website. Provide links to the most relevant elements in the CMS. Provide a link back to your support system if you have one.

=Appearance Menu=
With WordPress 3 comes the much need Menus option. However, this sits inside the Appearance menu which is hidden to editors. You can you make the Menus and Widgets menus available to editors, but can keep the switch theme menu removed.

Please note: The plugin works by granting Editor's the 'switch_themes' and 'edit_theme_options' privilege which gives them access to the Appearance menu, but removes the switch themes menu from the Appearance menu and the WordPress 3 Right Now dashboard. However it could still be possible for a Editor to switch themes, if they knew the direct url path. Unlikely, but you should be aware of this before you choose to enable these options.

Menus is only available to WordPress 3 users.

If you see menus like background or header, then you must modify your theme in order to remove them.

When the plugin is uninstalled, the Editor privileges are reset to their original values.

=How do I use it on Multi Site?=
* You must install the plugin network wide in order for it to work on all sites.
* You must save the options on each new site in order for the default options to appear.
* You can have separate login logos for each mini site. Simply change the filename, and upload it to the relevant theme.

=Troubleshooting=
I installed the plugin and the logos disappear?: You need to upload your logos to you current themes images directory.

The menus have not changes?: Make sure you are logged in as the editor

Lost Password CSS not working?: Make sure you use the example format. The color must be the last css style and it must not have a closing ; as !important is appended to the end of the style to overwrite and existing style.
